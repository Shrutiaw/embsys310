An example of Embedded System is a digiat camera. The basic functions of digital camera are :
-Capture images ,
-Stores images in digital format ,
-Download images to Computer System,

The advantage of didgital camera is there no need of film. The images are stored in the the form of data in the memory.
 
Detailed functions include:
CCD(change coupled device) array , ADC operations , JPEG encoding , USB or bluetooth for interfacing with computers , set of controlers , 
memory, display.


Design Challenges :
-Memory space - multiple images stored in camera Number depend on amount of memory and bits used per image.
-Security - Anyone can access the files.
-Design optimisation.
